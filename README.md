About The Project üíñ
Happy 6-month anniversary, my love! I wanted to create something unique and special for you instead of just getting a regular gift. This little website is a digital time capsule of our journey together so far. It's built from scratch with lots of love, a little bit of code, and countless memories of you.

It's filled with some of our favorite moments, inside jokes, and a couple of fun games. I hope it makes you smile!

Features üéÆ
This isn't just a static page; I've added some fun things for you to explore:

‚ú® Interactive Photo Gallery: A journey through our memories from the very first day.

üé® Dynamic Color Themes: You can change the entire website's color scheme to match your mood!

üïπÔ∏è "How Well Do You Know Us?" Quiz: A fun little mini-game to test our knowledge of each other.

üíå A Hidden Letter: There's a special message hidden somewhere on the site just for you. See if you can find it!

Tech Stack üíª
I built this project using the fundamental building blocks of the web:

HTML5: For the structure and content of the website.

CSS3: For all the styling, colors, animations, and making everything look pretty.

Vanilla JavaScript: To power the interactive elements, games, and color-changing magic.

To My Dearest [Girlfriend's Name]... ‚ú®
These past six months with you have been the most colorful and joyful months of my life. You make every single day feel like an adventure. This project is just a small token of my affection and a fun way to look back on all the laughter and happiness we've shared.

Thank you for being you. I can't wait to see what the next six months, and the six after that, have in store for us.

Happy Anniversary! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Made with lots of love by [Your Name]
